as you found, this is a starter project. i've only updated the manifest so far. Let's start simple. I want to start with a plugin to capture notes. It should work simliar to
the Journal plugin that has a 1-click way to create a date-stamped note. The note title should include the date (not time) and a title. The notes should be organized in a
folders organized by year and month.
